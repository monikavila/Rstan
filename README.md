# Rstan
In this repository, I provide an Rscript with examples to run Rstan. The level of knowledge is intermediate, this means that you should have some knowledge
on Stan and Bayesian econometrics. 
I do not aim to explain all the details of Bayesian econometrics neither Rstan usage. Instead, I provide an Rscript with different STAN models that is easy to run and 
modify to suit your needs.
